# ekmmeters 0.3

Python API for the EKM Omnimeter Serial Interface

The goal of this library is to provide a reliable and flexible interface to the EKM Omnimeter v.3, EKM Omnimeter, v.4, and EKM Omnimeter v.5

To get started, you can clone the repo: 'git clone https://github.com/ekmmetering/ekmmeters' in your working directory and include with 'from ekmmeters import *'.

Adaptable examples for all supported Omnimeter commands can be found at <a href="http://ekmmeters.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
readthedocs.org</a>.


The library is written to be compatible with existing EKM field naming conventions and to be accessible to both the casual and experienced user.  You should not need to have more than a few hours of Python 2.x experience to write a script for any Omnimeter command or create a short program to store your reads in a database.

More experienced Python users will find appropriate methods to support agents agents which store data locally or in the cloud, manage meter settings, and act as the client in publish/subscribe systems.  The library  supports standard Python serialization with Python 2.x multiprocessing and queueing, all ingoing and outgoing buffers are avaliable in JSON-friendly dictionary objects, and a smalll automated unit test framework provides simplest-possible coverage of all supported commands.  

#Fine Print

The library is a single file and pure Python.  You can install with 'pip ekmmeters', 'pip3 install ekmmeters' or download ekmmeters.py and place it in your project directory.  There are no external dependencies for ekmmeters.py beyond the pypi packages json, collections, importlib and pyserial.  

Unit tests require the unittests2 pypi package, along with random and ConfigParser.  The unit tests are not included
in the pypi release, and additional packages may be required for unit tests in the future.  The documentation for readthedocs.org was built under Sphinx 1.35. Google style docstrings are used exclusively, and read via the Sphinx napoleon extension.  Docs can be built locally with the sphinx_rtd_theme pypi package installed.

There are three specific and consistentlly applied PEP 8 violations, driven by use as a library for an existing, already documented application domain.  Constant and static names which refer to Omnimeter entities, in keeping with EKM naming in other systems, are in StudlyCase. Method names preserve the same entity naming in camelCase.  And -- while every attempt was made to keep column length under 80 columns, in the few cases where WYSIWYG naming conflicted, descriptive names are used.  However, the PyCharm PEP lint setting of 120 columns is observed in every case.  Outside of PEP 8, formal ABC decorators were not used for the simple 2 level object model.  

There is no required third party tool set for editing the library.  However, Pycharm 5.04 was used for development and the project xml is included as a convenience in the .idea directory.  The library is designed to encapsulate all meter constants, limits, and field names. An editor with intellisense style drop downs (any such editor) may be helpful.
